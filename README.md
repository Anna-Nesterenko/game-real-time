Tic-tac-toe game in real time with the ability to correspond in chat with your opponent.
Implemented with stream-chat. User save and game state with universal-cookie.

I need to finalize the appearance of the game and refactoring /16.11.2022/

p.s. Since my country is under constant attack, from a terrorist country - the app has been uploaded to the git so far without refactoring.
